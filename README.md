## Jupyter Notebook File
The jupyter notebook contained in this repository in the PyCitySchools folder analyzes data for a school district. This analysis included merging csv files together and generating descriptive statistics at the district and school levels. 



The notebook is organized into two top level headings/sections. 
1. First is the School Anlaysis section which contains the code to generate - and the output of - the district and school-level summary statistics. Observations of trends in the school-level summary statistics are presented at the top of this first section. 

2. Second is a section called Summarizing Findings. In this second section, the tables containing summary statistics are presented without the code to generate them. This second section is so users can easily access the dataframes produced in the analysis. 


## Resources Folder and Files
The resources folder contains the two csv files used in the analysis.
